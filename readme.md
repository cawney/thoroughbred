Reducer is on the right track for parsing the source file for the pedigree and making it work well.

Need to isolate the "\" and the "\b" & "\b0" for the end of a line along with the begin and end bold.
Once those are isolated, I'll be able to wrok on splitting it up and then programatically make a pedigree
from scratch.
